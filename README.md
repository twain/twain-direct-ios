# TWAIN Direct iOS Sample

A simple universal iOS app that scans images using the TWAIN Direct protocol. Intended as a developer sample, the app is light on usability but demonstrates the key aspects of acquiring images using TWAIN Direct:

* Discovering scanners.
* Creating a TWAIN Direct session.
* Sending a task configuration to the scanner.
* Starting a scan.
* Transferring image blocks.
* Assembling blocks into a final PDF.

The app is built in Swift. The TWAIN Direct protocol code is included directly in the project, not a separate framework or library, but can serve as an example or starting point for any application that wants to acquire images.

## Getting Started
Open the project in Xcode.  Build and run.  The app should work in the simulator or on your devices.

## License
License TBD
